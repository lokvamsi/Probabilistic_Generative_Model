# Probabilistic Generative Model
A C++ implementation of a probabilistic generative machine learning model for binary classification.

Here, we assume the class-conditioned densities p(x|Ck) are gaussian with both classes sharing the same covariance matrix.

Also, assume the posterior probabilities are given by a sigmoidal function.
